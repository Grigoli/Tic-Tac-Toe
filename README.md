# Tic-Tac-Toe
In this program I have designed and implement a class that allows a person to play a two player game of tic-tac-toe on a 3x3 grid that is a 3x3 array of integers. 

The input of the game is either from keyboard or if detected the presence of a text file named game.txt.  If an input file exists then it will run each game provided in the file until there are no more games to run, and then will write the array state out to a json string representation of the array for each game and then stop execution. 

The game has implemented computer AI.
